we were walking through the land,
holding each other‚Äôs hand.
The moon shone, reflecting off the sand‚Äî
it was like pearls fallen on the land.

But still, you are the prettiest girl
who was ever made by God‚Äôs hand.

Ohh my girl,

I can still feel your fragrance,
and that night, you were just looking like
a fairy on the land.

Ohh girl...

I love you, and I love your presence,
but you loved me as a friend.
The way you smile‚Äîit heals my soul.

I still love you as I loved you before.
But every time, I was just in your friend zone.

Ohh girl,
I still remember
when we were by the river.
You asked me,
"What do you want as a lover?"
And I said, ‚ÄúJust your love, your smile, your time, your favour.‚Äù

Ohh my girl,
I want you...

Neither less nor more.
Girl, I still love you,
as I loved you before.`}

Afraid of flights,
Thinking the nest was my whole life,
Playing with my siblings all through the night.

Then one day a hurricane came,
And shattered my whole sight.
My dad protected us with all his might,
Holding the nest, wings and claws clenched tight.

But I could see the wildness of the wind,
Weakening him night by night.
It hurt my soul,
To see my parents getting old.

So, I made a choice; I leaped from the nest,
And now I try my very best.

Leaving them is never easy,
But I have to fly,
To see the limits of the sky.`}

A quiet, faded drop, lost and plain.
Just a dull reflection, with nothing to shine,
A flower forgotten, left behind.

Not a star in the sky or a spark in the night,
Just a shadow that blends, out of sight.
No warmth, no glow, no beauty to see,
Nothing that stands out in me.`}
